# Embedded HOWFSC Benchmarks

Contains code for the evaluation of the CPU Processors for the MIT APRA project. The different make files target different processors. You can configure which benhcmarks to execute with preprocessor definitions in the makefile. Any other changes to the benchmark configuration must be made in the source code. This relies on math_utils which contain code from Numerical Recipes in C.
